        <p class="text">Agriculture in Nepal has long been based on subsistence farming,
            particularly in the hilly regions where peasants derive their living from fragmented plots of land
            cultivated in difficult conditions.
            Government programs to introduce irrigation facilities and fertilizers have proved inadequate, their
            delivery hampered by the mountainous
            terrain. Population increases and environmental degradation have ensured that the minimal gains in
            agricultural production,
            owing more to the extension of arable land than to improvements in farming practices, have been
            cancelled out.

                The Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) is a comprehensive initiative launched by the Government of
                Nepal in 2015 to promote sustainable agricultural growth, reduce poverty, and increase food security in
                the country. The strategy aims to improve the livelihoods of farmers by increasing agricultural
                productivity, enhancing market access, and promoting modern farming practices. The ADS also prioritizes
                sustainable agriculture practices to mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture. The strategy
                is implemented through various government agencies and institutions, including the Ministry of
                Agriculture and Livestock Development, the Department of Agriculture, and the Nepal Agricultural

                <strong>Limited access to credit and finance:</strong>
                 Access to credit and finance is a significant challenge for
                smallholder farmers in Nepal. Many farmers lack access to credit, which hinders their ability to invest

            </div>
            <div class="challenges_points text">
                <strong>Limited access to markets:</strong>
                 Many farmers in Nepal face challenges accessing markets to sell their
                produce. This is due to poor market linkages, inadequate transportation infrastructure, and limited
                access to market information.

                <strong>Limited adoption of modern technologies:</strong>
                 Many farmers in Nepal continue to rely on traditional farming
                methods and have limited access to modern farming technologies and practices. This hinders their ability
                to increase agricultural productivity and yields.
            </div>

                <strong>Climate change and natural disasters:</strong>
                 Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters, including floods,
                landslides, and droughts, which can significantly impact agricultural production. Climate change is also
                a significant challenge for Nepal's agriculture sector, as it can lead to changing weather patterns,
                increased pest and disease pressures, and reduced crop yields.
