        <p class="text">Agriculture in Nepal has long been based on subsistence farming,
            particularly in the hilly regions where peasants derive their living from fragmented plots of land
            cultivated in difficult conditions.
            Government programs to introduce irrigation facilities and fertilizers have proved inadequate, their
            delivery hampered by the mountainous
            terrain. Population increases and environmental degradation have ensured that the minimal gains in
            agricultural production,
            owing more to the extension of arable land than to improvements in farming practices, have been
            cancelled out.

                        The Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) is a comprehensive initiative launched by the
                        Government of
                        Nepal in 2015 to promote sustainable agricultural growth, reduce poverty, and increase food
                        security in
                        the country. The strategy aims to improve the livelihoods of farmers by increasing agricultural
                        productivity, enhancing market access, and promoting modern farming practices. The ADS also
                        prioritizes
                        sustainable agriculture practices to mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture. The
                        strategy
                        is implemented through various government agencies and institutions, including the Ministry of
                        Agriculture and Livestock Development, the Department of Agriculture, and the Nepal Agricultural
                        Research Council. The ADS is a long-term plan that aims to improve the agriculture sector in
                        Nepal over
                        the next 15 years.

                        The Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) is a long-term plan developed by the Government of Nepal
                        to
                        achieve inclusive and sustainable agricultural growth until 2030. The plan aims to promote
                        agricultural
                        growth, increase farmers' income, and improve food security in the country. The APP focuses on
                        increasing agricultural productivity by promoting modern farming practices, developing
                        appropriate
                        technologies, and improving irrigation and other infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the
                        need to
                        develop a strong value chain for agricultural products to ensure farmers receive a fair price
                        for their
                        produce. The APP is implemented through various government agencies and institutions, including
